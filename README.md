# Color Harmony
This project aims to offer a program able to harmonize the colors of an image using the harmony type (Complementary, analogous, triad, etc) chosen by the user.
This is a university project on which the students will be graded.

## How to use
There is a Makefile available to allow the compilation of the application.
You may need the package "libgtkmm-3.0-dev" to run the interface. ( apt-get install libgtkmm-3.0-dev )

## Limitations
The program only accepts images of the PPM format.
We may handle other image formats in the future.

## Steps
1. Writing and providing a "state of the art".
2. Choosing a single traditional harmonisation method and implementing it.
3. Testing and analysing the results. Evaluating those results.
4. Implementing a graphical interface.

## Languages and tools used
- C++ 
- Gtkmm3.0
